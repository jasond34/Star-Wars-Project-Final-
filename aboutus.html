						<h3>Rogue Trooper WIT-425</h3>
							Codename: Jason Dong<br>
							<br>Gender: Male<br>
							<br>Age: Unknown<br>
							<br>Affiliation: Galactic Empire <small>(Wentworth Institute of Tech.)</small><br>
							<br>Era(s): Rebellion Era, Clone Wars(Class of 2015)<br>
							
							<br>Famous Quotes: "Move along"<br>
							
							<br>Description:     WIT-425, often known as the "Unidentified head-bumping Stormtrooper",(see image below) is a graduate of the 
							Wentworth Institute of the Evil Galactic Empire. During an outbreak in the Deathstar, the squad's leader was eventually able to open the door, but as the group 
							barged in, the head-bumping WIT-425 did not account for his height and the 
							low clearance that the entrance presented. As a result of his helmet's poor field 
							of vision, WIT-425 knocked his head on the door, slowing his advance.
							From then on, he was know as the head-banging Stormtrooper to his fellow peers.
							Along with fellow trooper WIT-448, WIT-425 attended Wentworth and there they came under the tutelage of the evil
							Darth Chen-Hsiang Yu. They both were tasked with a massive project of creating a website and what you see here
							is the result.

								slavery	by the evil gangster unitl WIT-425 saved his ass.							<br>
